Features
Player Movement: Control a turtle character to move up and down.

Moving Cars: Cars continuously move across the screen, posing an obstacle.

Level System: Successfully crossing the road advances the player to the next level.

Scoreboard: Tracks the current level the player has reached.

Game Over: If the player collides with a car, the game ends.
